                <p><i> Christ instituted the sacraments of the new law. There are seven: Baptism, Confirmation (or
                        Chrismation), the Eucharist, Penance, the Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders and Matrimony. The
                        seven sacraments touch all the stages and all the important moments of Christian life: they give
                        birth and increase, healing and mission to the Christian's life of faith. There is thus a
                        certain resemblance between the stages of natural life and the stages of the spiritual life.

                <h1>Baptism</h1>
                <p>"Holy Baptism is the basis of the whole Christian life, the gateway to life in the Spirit (vitae
                    spiritualis ianua), and the door which gives access to the other sacraments. Through Baptism we are
                    freed from sin and reborn as sons of God; we become members of Christ, are incorporated into the
                    Church and made sharers in her mission: 'Baptism is the sacrament of regeneration through water in
                    the word.'"
                    <br> <br>
                    --Catechism of the Catholic Church,
                    paragraph 1213 (empasis added)
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="innerblock">
                <h1>Confirmation</h1>
                <p>Confirmation deepens our baptismal life that calls us to be missionary witnesses of Jesus Christ in
                    our families, neighborhoods, society, and the world. . . We receive the message of faith in a deeper
                    and more intensive manner with great emphasis given to the person of Jesus Christ, who asked the
                    Father to give the Holy Spirit to the Church for building up the community in loving service.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="innerblock">
                <h1>The Eucharist</h1>
                <p>“From this moment on, live the Eucharist fully;
                    be persons for whom the Holy Mass, Communion, and Eucharistic adoration
                    are the center and summit of their whole life.”</p>
            </div>
            <div class="innerblock">
                <h1>Penance</h1>
                <p>"Now is the time to say to Jesus:
                    “Lord, I have let myself be deceived; in a thousand ways I have shunned Your love,
                    yet here I am once more, to renew my covenant with You. I need You.
                    Save me once again, Lord, take me once more into Your redeeming embrace”.

                    How good it feels to come back to Him whenever we are lost!
                    Let me say this once more: God never tires of forgiving us;
                    we are the ones who tire of seeking His mercy." <br> <br>

                    -Pope Francis, Evangelli Gaudium, 3 </p>
            </div>
            <div class="innerblock">
                <h1>Holy Matrimony</h1>
                <p> The Sacrament of Marriage is a covenant, which is more than a contract. Covenant always expresses a relationship between persons. The marriage covenant refers to the relationship between the husband and wife, a permanent union of persons capable of knowing and loving each other and God. The celebration of marriage is also a liturgical act, appropriately held in a public liturgy at church. Catholics are urged to celebrate their marriage within the Eucharistic Liturgy. <br> <br> Sacred Scripture begins with the creation and union of man and woman and ends with "the wedding feast of the Lamb" (Rev 19:7, 9). Scripture often refers to marriage, its origin and purpose, the meaning God gave to it, and its renewal in the covenant made by Jesus with his Church.  Man and woman were created for each other. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="innerblock">
                <h1>Holy Orders</h1>
                <p>"Every high priest is taken from among men and made their representative before God, to offer gifts
                    and sacrifices for sins. He is able to deal patiently with erring sinners, for he himself is beset
                    by weakness and so must make sin offerings for himself as well as for the people. One does not take
                    this honor on his own initiative, but only when called by God as Aaron was. Even Christ did not
                    glorify Himself with the office of high priest: He received it from the One who said to Him: ‘You
                    are a priest forever …”   (Hebrews 5:1-6)
                    <br> <br>
                    Holy Orders are the sacrament of service and love which addresses the “order of the Church". This
                    sacrament insures that the Church will act sacramentally, proclaiming the Gospel in word, sacrament,
                    witness and service. <br> <br>

                    If you are thinking about a religious vocation contact our parish priest to discuss God’s call and
                    to seek further information.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="innerblock">
                <h1>Anointing of the Sick</h1>
                <p>As the sick unite their sufferings to those of Christ, they become bearers of the joy of the Holy
                    Spirit in the midst of affliction and witnesses of Christ’s Resurrection. Anointing of the Sick
                    testifies to the fact that all are called to participate in the redemption of the world. We all have
                    a role in sanctifying and building up the Church, whatever our physical condition.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="innerblock">
                <h1>Funerals</h1>
                <p>"At the death of a Christian, whose life of faith was begun inthe waters of Baptism and strengthened at the Eucharistic table, the Church intercedes on behalf of the deceased because of its confident belief that death is not the end, nor does it break the bonds forged in life. The Church also ministers to the sorrowing and consoles them in the funeral rites with the comforting Word of God and the Sacrament of the Eucharist."

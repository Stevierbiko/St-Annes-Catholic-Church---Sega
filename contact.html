            </div>
            <p class="accordion-content">
               To be Catholic means to be pursuing a life fully alive in Christ.
               This means pursuing Jesus in personal prayer and especially in the
               sacraments, building community in the Church, placing your whole
               life at the disposal of Jesus, and striving to live a life of
               holiness, as laid out for us by Jesus in the Scriptures and Holy
               Tradition.

               <br />
               The life of a Catholic Christian is a radical life, make no mistake.
               But it is also the most joy-filled, amazing life you could possibly
               live!

               <br />
               The question: "What does it look like for me to be Catholic?" Well,
               that's a question that only God can answer!

               Becoming Catholic is a process that involves building your own personal relationship with Jesus,
               investing in the Church community, receiving knowledge of Christ and His Church, and going through
               several different 'rites' to become 'fully initiated'.

               For those who have already been baptized in another Christian denomination, at the end of your journey
               (really, just the beginning of a new journey!) you will receive your first Holy Communion and
               Confirmation.

               If you have never been baptized, you will go through the same process, but you will also be received into
               the Church first through baptism.

               Being Catholic, however, is a lifelong pursuit!

            <p class="accordion-content">
               RCIA (stands for Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults) is the official name for the process of becoming
               Catholic. This involves teachings, classes, meetings with a sponsor, rites within Mass, and finally,
               receiving your sacraments in the Church!

            <p class="accordion-content">
               This depends on each person. Most people invest at least a year - it takes a long time to learn what it
               means to be Catholic, as well as to wrestle with questions and build relationships within the Church. But
               there is no set timetable and no rush. Some poeple take one year, others take three or even many more!
               What matters is that you are walking in lockstep with God - He will reveal the right timing for
               <strong>you</strong> .

               A sponsor is a fully initiated Catholic who will walk with someone who is becoming Catholic. They will
               guide you, be your sounding board, and help you find answers to your questions. Ideally, your sponsor is
               someone you admire for their faith, hope, and love - and someone who challenges you to grow in faith,
               hope, and love too.

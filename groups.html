                <p><i> When the Church comes together in the liturgical assembly to celebrate the Mass, or any other
                        sacrament, her members do not gather simply as a crowd, as an amorphous, undifferentiated group
                        of people. They gather in a variety of ministries and roles. If we are to understand the
                        significance of these ministries and roles, we must begin with Baptism, for only one who through
                        Baptism has been given a share in the priesthood of Christ is capable of participating in the
                        public worship which is the liturgy of the Church. In fact, the Constitution on the Sacred
                        Liturgy of the Second Vatican Council tells us that participation in the liturgy is the
                        <strong>right </strong> and <strong>duty </strong> of all the baptized.</i></p>

                <h1>Mass Servers</h1>
                <p>Boys and girls 5th grade and older serve at God’s altar during the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. This
                    ministry helps the servers enter more deeply into the mystery of the Holy Mass and assist with its
                    celebration. One seeking to serve in this capacity should desire to grow more closely to Jesus in
                    the Eucharist and be an example of faith among friends. Please encourage your children to become
                    involved in this ministry if you see those qualities in them.

                <h1>Ushers</h1>
                <p>Men and women 18 and older take up the collection, assist in helping to find seats for those entering
                    late or for large Masses, offer information, guidance, and supervision of the congregation, and are
                    vigilant of any problems that might develop during Mass. Ushers also help to restore order to the
                    pews and church following each Mass, such as up-righting kneelers, clearing any trash from the pews,
                    and organizing hymnals.</p>

                <h1>CHOIR MEMBERS, CANTORS</h1>
                <p>Realising the value and contribution of music to any celebration the Parish strives to provide
                    appropriate music at as many parish liturgies as possible.

                    The Parish is led by a variety of music groups including choirs, organists, youth bands and other
                    instrumentalist.

                    If you would like to share your gift of music, either as a musician of a vocalist please free to
                    either join in an existing group, or look at beginning a group with others who share your passion
                    for music</p>

                <h1>Lectors/Readers</h1>
                <p>The Lector proclaims the Word of God during Mass and reads the Prayers of the Faithful. This is a
                    vital part of our faith community’s worship. Members of the faith community who have received
                    Confirmation and who are comfortable with a public, proclaiming role at Mass may become a Lector.
                    Lectors should prepare well and be willing to grow in their personal prayer life, especially through
                    reflection upon the scriptures. The Parish provides both printed and web-based liturgy resources to
                    help lectors in their preparation for their proclamation. Lectors are rostered on a rotating
                    schedule and should arrive 15 minutes before the Liturgy. </p>

                    Catechists do more than simply teaching the faith. A Catechist shares their faith and guides
                    their students to learn how to apply and live their faith, as well.
                    <br> <br><strong>"Catechists are people who keep the memory of God alive;
